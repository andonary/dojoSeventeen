## Dojo time Math( Niveau 6)

Given two times in hours, minutes, and seconds (ie '15:04:24'), add or subtract them. This is a 24 hour clock. Output should be two digits for all numbers: hours, minutes, seconds (ie '04:02:09').

## Josephus Survivor ( Niveau 5) 

Il est juste mortel... il en restera 1 comme dans Highlander

In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.

Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

Exemple:


```
    josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle;
    one every 3 is eliminated until one remains

    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence
    [1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out
    [1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out
    [1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out
    [1,4,5] => 7 is counted out
    [1,4] => 5 is counted out
    [4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!
```

The above link about the "base" kata description will give you a more thorough insight about the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all that there is to know to solve this kata.
